**Description:** My Mobile Game Workshop project, developed over a month in Unity.

**Concept:** A rhythm game that also has runner elements, so you can feel adrenaline from jumping through buildings and not missing a beat. 
The idea comes from the shared experience of imagining someone doing parkour outside your car window as a kid (or adult!).

**Controls:** You can tap, hold, or swipe your screen in three different directions.

**Features:** Combos, a scoring system, and hit accuracy.
